Project by Aryasatya Wiryawan - 5025221256

DAA (D)

A Laravel 12 prototype that lets you manage meeting rooms and meeting requests, then uses a **greedy interval-scheduling** algorithm to assign as many non-overlapping meetings to each room as possible.

## üîç Features

- **Rooms CRUD**: create, edit, delete rooms  
- **Meetings CRUD**: create, edit, delete meeting requests (title, start & end time)  
- **Scheduler**: ‚ÄúOptimize Meetings‚Äù button runs a greedy algorithm to assign meetings to rooms  
- **Date-scoped**: filter and optimize by a specific date  
- **CSV Export**: download the current room-meeting assignments

## ü§ñ Algorithm

We implement the **interval-scheduling** greedy algorithm (Lecture #9, Ch. 16):

1. **Sort** all meeting requests by their **start** time (or finish time).
2. Keep an array of **room availability**: each room‚Äôs last-assigned end time.
3. **Iterate** through meetings in order:

   * Find the first room whose last-end ‚â§ meeting‚Äôs start
   * **Assign** the meeting to that room and update its last-end to the meeting‚Äôs end
4. Continue until all meetings are processed.
