# Meeting Room Booking Optimizer

A Laravel 12 prototype that lets you manage meeting rooms and meeting requests, then uses a **greedy interval-scheduling** algorithm to assign as many non-overlapping meetings to each room as possible.

---

## 🔍 Features

- **Rooms CRUD**: create, edit, delete rooms  
- **Meetings CRUD**: create, edit, delete meeting requests (title, start & end time)  
- **Scheduler**: “Optimize Meetings” button runs a greedy algorithm to assign meetings to rooms  
- **Date-scoped**: filter and optimize by a specific date  
- **CSV Export**: download the current room-meeting assignments

## 🤖 Algorithm

We implement the **interval-scheduling** greedy algorithm (Lecture #9, Ch. 16):

1. **Sort** all meeting requests by their **start** time (or finish time).
2. Keep an array of **room availability**: each room’s last-assigned end time.
3. **Iterate** through meetings in order:

   * Find the first room whose last-end ≤ meeting’s start
   * **Assign** the meeting to that room and update its last-end to the meeting’s end
4. Continue until all meetings are processed.
